# CryptoClustering
# 📊 Crypto Clustering Analysis

[Download here](https://github.com/almikmrzadrot898/CryptoClustering/releases)

This project performs **cryptocurrency market clustering** using machine learning techniques such as **K-Means clustering** and **Principal Component Analysis (PCA)**. The goal is to analyze, visualize, and compare clustering results with and without dimensionality reduction to better understand the structure of crypto asset markets.

## 🚀 Features

- 📈 Optimal k value detection using the Elbow Method
- 🧪 K-Means clustering on scaled original features
- ⚙️ Dimensionality reduction using PCA
- 🔍 Visual comparison of clusters before and after PCA
- 📊 Interactive visualizations with `hvPlot`

## 🧰 Technologies Used

- Python
- Pandas & Scikit-learn
- PCA
- KMeans Clustering
- hvPlot

## 📌 Insights

- 📍 PCA retained **90%** of the data's variance with 3 components.
- 📍 Optimal `k` changed from **5 (original)** to **4 (PCA)**.
- 📍 Clustering with PCA led to clearer, better-separated clusters.


## 🧑‍💻 Usage

1. Clone the repo  
   ```bash
   git clone 
   
2. Open the notebook in Jupyter or VSCode.

3. Run through the steps to visualize the crypto clusters.
